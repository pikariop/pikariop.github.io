# Hello world! 

I have been toying with the idea of blogging about some aspects of my life for a while, namely hiking, cycling and making my own gear for both pursuits. Since I'm currently blessed with more free time than usual, I decided to give it a go and actually start something instead of daydreams and procrastination.

Let's see what will follow.

# Under the hood
This blog runs on [Jekyll][jekyll] and is hosted using [GitHub Pages][github-pages]. As a software geek and a DIY enthusiast, I couldn't imagine anything more up to the task.

Originally I got the idea of using Jekyll from the mighty Hendrik of [Hiking in Finland][hendrik], although he uses Octopress to be precise. At this time, Octopress seems a bit unmaintained, so I decided to go with plain Jekyll instead.

You are most welcome to [fork me on GitHub][fork-me].
